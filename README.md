# Charting-Happiness-A-Personal-Exploration-of-Wellbeing-Through-the-Years

## Project Overview
This project is a personal exploration of my own wellbeing journey, spanning different life stages and focusing on key factors such as mental health, finances, lifestyle, relationships, and spiritual growth. By leveraging Excel for data organization and analysis and Power BI for dynamic visualizations, I was able to uncover trends and insights that offer a roadmap for a more balanced and fulfilling future.

## Tools and Data
Excel: Data cleaning and regression analysis.

Power BI: Dynamic dashboards for data visualization.
Personal Wellbeing Data: Self-tracked data from apps like Fitbit and Apple Health, along with daily journal entries.

External Data: Insights from academic studies and reports about sleep, exercise, and stress impacts on wellbeing.


## Methedology
➡️Data Collection: I manually recorded wellbeing data across the key dimensions (mental health, finances, relationships, lifestyle, and spiritual growth) in Excel, using tables and formulas for data organization.

➡️Analysis: Excel: Used functions like XLOOKUP, conditional formatting, and pivot tables to identify patterns and correlations.

➡️Visualization: Dynamic visuals in Power BI helped bring my journey to life, showcasing how different factors influenced each stage of my life.

## Results
#### 1. Wellbeing Across Life Stages
Using Excel, I tracked and rated my overall wellbeing across four major life stages: Childhood, Adolescence, Early Adulthood, and Future Milestones. Power BI enabled me to visualize these trends and identify areas of growth and challenge.

Overall Wellbeing Rating:

Childhood: 4.8 (A steady foundation with potential for growth)

Adolescence: 5.80 (Growth paired with challenges)

Early Adulthood: 5.51 (Life transitions lead to shifts in stability)

Future Milestones: 6.46 (A predicted improvement fueled by maturity and stability)

Key Influencers of Wellbeing:

Relationships, career, lifestyle, financial stability, and spiritual growth emerged as major contributors to my overall wellbeing.

#### 2. Mental Health Matters: Trends and Insights
I explored mental health dynamics through data points such as stress, anxiety, therapy, and happiness.

Key Observations by Life Stage:

Childhood & Adolescence: Moderate stress and anxiety levels with minimal engagement in therapy.

Early Adulthood: Stress and anxiety peaked during career-building and relationship navigation.

Future Milestones: Predictive analysis suggests a rise in happiness and improved mental health due to increased stability and self-awareness.

Influencers on Mental Health:

My analysis in Power BI revealed a strong correlation between dips in spiritual growth and increases in stress and anxiety. Conversely, higher levels of spiritual engagement boosted overall happiness and resilience.

#### 3. My Money Journey: Balancing Finances and Life
By analyzing my financial habits across life stages, I uncovered trends in savings, investment, and debt. Excel formulas and Power BI dashboards helped me track these changes and identify areas for improvement.

Key Metrics Across Life Stages:

Savings: Began low in Childhood (0.00), peaked in Adolescence (15.45), and stabilized by Future Milestones (14.39).

Investment: Gradually increased from Early Adulthood (12.47) to Future Milestones.

Debt: Peaked in Early Adulthood (10.39) due to life investments such as education and career development.

Financial Wellbeing Insights:

Financial stability strongly correlated with improvements in lifestyle satisfaction. A 0.33 increase in lifestyle satisfaction consistently improved my financial outlook.

This section reflects on significant milestones and their influence on relationships, lifestyle, and career growth.

Key Observations:

Relationships: Gradual improvement over time but strongly tied to mental health and financial wellbeing.

Lifestyle: Grew consistently with career advancements and financial literacy.

Spiritual Growth: Fluctuated during major life changes, with periods of decline coinciding with heightened stress.
